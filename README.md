# SMS Spam Classification using NLP

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on building an **SMS Spam Classification system** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques.  
The objective is to classify SMS messages as **Spam** or **Ham (Not Spam)** based on their textual content.

The dataset used is the **SMSSpamCollection**, which contains labeled SMS messages.

## 📂 Dataset
- **Name:** SMSSpamCollection  
- **Format:** Tab-separated text file  
- **Columns:**
  - `label` → spam / ham  
  - `message` → SMS text

## 🛠️ Current Work (In Progress)
✔️ Data loading and inspection  
✔️ Text preprocessing (lowercasing, cleaning, tokenization)  
✔️ **Feature extraction using Bag of Words (CountVectorizer)**  

🔄 Currently working on:
- Building numerical representations of text using **Bag of Words**
- Preparing features for machine learning models

## 🔍 NLP Techniques Used
- Text cleaning
- Tokenization
- Stopword removal
- **Bag of Words (BoW)** representation

## 🚀 Planned Next Steps
- Apply **TF-IDF Vectorization**
- Train classification models:
  - Naive Bayes
  - Logistic Regression
- Model evaluation using:
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
